This hand written work is applying Calculus derivative to come
up with optimal revenue.

Ultimately, knowing that the the optimal of a curve is reached when the derivative
is zero.

So, thus the the optimal revenue is generated when the change of revenue to the
change of price(price of annualh membership) is at 0.

Trick to this problem solving is coming up with Y-intercept and slope.

             $500 - 5D => 180 + 3D
             
             When discount of $5 is applied, monthly sales increased by 3.
            
Another trick is coming up with Y = MX + B

    Where Y represents Sales and X represents Price.
    
    f(X) = Y = MX + B
    
    Sales(Price) = M*Price + B
    
    (Q)Solve for price equal to $0.
    $500 - 5D = 0
    $500      = 5D
          100 = D
          
    D represents unit of discount where each unit is $5 discount.
    
    180 + 3(100) = 480 
    
    When there is 100 units of discount ($500), the expected sales would be 480.
    
    So 480 becomes the Y-intercept (B).
    
    Now the equation becomes Y = M * Price + 480
    
  Trick is now coming up with M.
  
      Change of Sales / Change of Price =  - 3D / 5D = - 0.6
      
     Now the equation is more defined.
     
     Y = -0.6 Price + 480
     
  Trick is now coming up with Revenue formulae:
  
     Revenue = Sales * Price
             = (-0.6Price + 480) * Price
             = -0.6Price^2 + 480Price
             
    Now the trick is know that the peak has derivative of zero.
    
    The graph is -P^2 which has peak at the top.
    
    d(Revenue)/d(Price) = -1.2Price + 480
    
    Now solve for zero,  
    
        -1.2*Price + 480 = 0
        -1.2*Price       = -480
        
             Price       = $400
